Inspired by Nitin Kapania's Stanford Ph.D. thesis, Coursera's Introduction to Self-Driving Cars, and Charlotte Dorn's Indianapolis waypoint tracking project, this project reimplements Kapania's path generation algorithm. We tested it by running a high-speed virtual Audi TT on the Thunderhill racetrack, using CALAR to simulate an autonomous vehicle.

This paper, published at CoRL 2024, presents Event3DGS: Event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting for High-Speed Robot Egomotion. Developed as a course project at the University of Maryland, this implementation uses [nerfstudio](https://docs.nerf.studio/) and [EventNeRF](https://github.com/r00tman/EventNeRF) to train 3D Gaussian Splatting for event camera data.
